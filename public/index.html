        <p>
          These are the technical competencies that I've used most in my professional career.
          In addition to these, I've dabbled with many other languages and technologies,
          but listing those here would hide my core competencies.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

        <h3>Lindex 2019 - now</h3>
        <p>
          Improved exception logging to quickly find and understand productions
          bugs and fix them before affecting sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented an internationalized sitemap to boost SEO results.
        </p>

        <h3>Antura 2019 - 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Implemented a monitoring dashbord in React to see the status,
          progress, and more for a set of distributed microservices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented a library in .NET that allowed developers to build, with
          minimal boilerplate, distributed microservices that could run
          background tasks, and safely communicate the progress and results of
          those tasks
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on many smaller tasks, such as fixing bugs in a monolithic .NET
          WebForms application, implementing rigoruous property based tests in
          F#, improving performance of a React frontend, and modernizing an old
          iOS app
        </p>

        <h3>Starcounter 2016 - 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Planned, built, and shipped a cross-platform CLI tool with .NET Core
          for managing databases and applications. Required runtime
          code-generation, and an extensible architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investigated and implemented a solution that made it possible for .NET
          Core apps built on Starcounter’s application platform to work on
          Linux. Built a common foreign function interface and surrounding
          plumbing to allow interoperability between two C# and C++ libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed, together with DevOps, a solution for managing NuGet
          packages containing managed and unmanaged code which radically
          simplified development and the continuous integration system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increased the usability of a complex software product by authoring and
          improving hundreds of pages of documentation.

        <h2>Eduction</h2>
        <p>
          I've learned what I know in four different ways: books, formal education, online courses, and practical experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2014, I've read at least one book per week. Many of these are technical books such as:
          ASP.NET Core in Action, Scrum and XP from the Trenches, The Rust Programming Language, Stylish F#,
          Dependency Injection in .NET, Clean Code, and Working Effectively with Legacy Code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of formal education, starting 2019, I'm in the program Software Engineering and Management at Gothenburg University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've completed a wide range of online courses, for example: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Front-End Developer Nanodegree at Udacity
            </li>
            <li>
              React Nanodegree at Udacity
            </li>
            <li>
              Asynchronous Programming in C# and .NET by Microsoft on EdX
            </li>
            <li>
              Fundamentals of Computing by Rice University on Coursera
            </li>
            <li>
              Chinese for Beginners by Peking University on Coursera
            </li>
            <li>
              Encapsulation and SOLID by Mark Seeman on Pluralsight
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I've completed many more than the one's listed above, but writing them down here doesn't provide much additional value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of what I've learned is from practical experience, primarily from work, but also from small hobby projects that I've done.
        </p>

        <p>

        <p>
          Won Oslo International Model United Nations 2016, a three day long debate and negotiation competition.
