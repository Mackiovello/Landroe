        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

        <h3>Lindex 2019 - now</h3>
        <p>
          Improved exception logging to quickly find and understand productions
          bugs and fix them before affecting sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented an internationalized sitemap to boost SEO results.
        </p>

        <h3>Antura 2019 - 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Implemented a monitoring dashbord in React to see the status,
          progress, and more for a set of distributed microservices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented a library in .NET that allowed developers to build, with
          minimal boilerplate, distributed microservices that could run
          background tasks, and safely communicate the progress and results of
          those tasks
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on many smaller tasks, such as fixing bugs in a monolithic .NET
          WebForms application, implementing rigoruous property based tests in
          F#, improving performance of a React frontend, and modernizing an old
          iOS app
        </p>

        <h3>Starcounter 2016 - 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Planned, built, and shipped a cross-platform CLI tool with .NET Core
          for managing databases and applications. Required runtime
          code-generation, and an extensible architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investigated and implemented a solution that made it possible for .NET
          Core apps built on Starcounter’s application platform to work on
          Linux. Built a common foreign function interface and surrounding
          plumbing to allow interoperability between two C# and C++ libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed, together with DevOps, a solution for managing NuGet
          packages containing managed and unmanaged code which radically
          simplified development and the continuous integration system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increased the usability of a complex software product by authoring and
          improving hundreds of pages of documentation.
